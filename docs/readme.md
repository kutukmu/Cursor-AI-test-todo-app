# Todo App Documentation

## Overview

This is a full-featured todo application with real-time synchronization capabilities.

## Key Features

1. **Real-time Sync**: All todos are stored in Convex and sync automatically across devices
2. **Beautiful UI**: Gradient backgrounds, smooth animations, and modern design
3. **Rich Interactions**: Swipe to delete, long press to edit, haptic feedback
4. **Smart Filtering**: View all, active, or completed tasks
5. **Statistics**: Track your progress with real-time stats

## Architecture

### Frontend (React Native + Expo)
- **Expo Router**: File-based routing for navigation
- **React Native Reanimated**: Smooth, performant animations
- **Gesture Handler**: Natural touch interactions

### Backend (Convex)
- **Real-time Database**: Auto-syncing data layer
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support
- **Serverless**: No server management needed

## Component Breakdown

### `app/index.tsx`
Main screen containing:
- Todo list with filtering
- Statistics dashboard
- Add todo input
- Filter buttons

### `components/AddTodo.tsx`
Input field for creating new todos with:
- Auto-focus on submit
- Keyboard handling
- Submit animations

### `components/TodoItem.tsx`
Individual todo with:
- Checkbox for completion
- Long-press to edit
- Swipe gesture to delete
- Delete button

### `components/TodoStats.tsx`
Statistics cards showing:
- Total todos
- Active todos
- Completed todos
- Completion percentage

## Convex Functions

### Queries
- `getTodos`: Fetches all todos sorted by creation time

### Mutations
- `addTodo`: Creates a new todo
- `toggleTodo`: Toggles completion status
- `updateTodo`: Updates todo text
- `deleteTodo`: Removes a todo
- `clearCompleted`: Removes all completed todos

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Categories/tags for todos
- [ ] Due dates and reminders
- [ ] Priority levels
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
- [ ] Drag to reorder
- [ ] Recurring tasks
- [ ] Subtasks
- [ ] Notes/descriptions

## Performance Considerations

- Uses FlatList for efficient rendering of large todo lists
- Animations run on UI thread via Reanimated
- Optimistic UI updates with Convex
- Lazy loading of images (if added)

## Accessibility

Current implementation includes:
- Semantic component structure
- Keyboard support
- Touch target sizes

Future improvements:
- Screen reader support
- High contrast mode
- Reduced motion support
- Voice input
